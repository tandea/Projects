In this project, I've build a mini-weather application using an external API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
Also, in this project I've used: 
*HTML5
*CSS3
*BOOTSTRAP
*JQUERY
*JAVASCRIPT

For my coding editor, I've used Visual Studio Code.

A new UI.
Adding a feature where the user can see multiple cities at once, and compare their temperature/ weather.
